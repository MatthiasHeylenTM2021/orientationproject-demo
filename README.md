See Canvas for detailed explanation on Github usage

Be sure that each team member is working according to the same flow:

1. Each team member always works on their own branch (= feature branch)
2. Once you finished a feature, you need to add a pull request (PR)
3. Another team member checks this PR, comments on code and approves or disapproves the PR
4. If this PR is approved, a merge to the 'master' branch occurs
5. Before going through this process again, you do another pull on the master branch so that your new feature branch starts from the most recent version
